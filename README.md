I am developing a full-stack project focused on candidate information. I will create a folder for the server, which will include a sub-folder for the database. After that, I will build the Node.js network using HTTP methods. Then, I will work on the front-end using React.js by executing the following command: `npx create-react-app sample-app`.

Next, I will install the necessary packages by running `npm install`.

To run my web application, follow these steps:

**For the Back-end:**
1. Navigate to the server folder: `cd Server`
2. Start the server: `node index.js`

**For the Front-end:**
1. Navigate to the front-end folder: `cd Front-end`
2. Enter the sample application folder: `cd sample-app`
3. Install the required packages: `npm install`
4. Start the front-end application: `npm start`
